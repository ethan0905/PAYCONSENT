  <h1>PayConsent ü§ù</h1>
  <p>A B2B payement protocol, secured using smartcontract</p>

</div>

## ü§è Pitch
We are 4 students from 42 school and we have been experiencing issues with our client payement. We create this projet to solve this with a smart contract store on a blockchain !

## ‚ùó Problem
#### What problem does your project solve? 
- Contract distortion
- Deadline for payement not respected
- Wrong amount
  
#### How does it fit into the theme "Building a Decentralized Future"?  
The solution is independant, self governing.  
We never gonna interact with the contract.

  
## ‚úÖ Solution
#### How did you resolve this issue?  
‚Üí We decided to solve this issue, by creating an easy to use and decentralized payement protocol service that protect the 2 users during transaction.  
‚Üí For each mission, we create a unique smart contract that is not editable and non replicable.  
‚Üí We store the documents on decentralised database (IPFS).
  
We create a trust environment for every users.  
  
#### What technologies did you use?  
TailwindCSS and ReactJS for frontend and backend  
Starton API for the smart contracts managements
IPFS for the decentralised datastorage  
  
#### What was your biggest technical challenge and how does your solution solve it?
?

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to run the project ? 
  
1. Clone the repository:  
`git clone https://github.com/ethan0905/hackathon.git`
 
2. Run at the root of repository, the following bash commands:  
`docker-compose up --build`
    
3. Then go to the following url on internet:  
`localhost:3000`  
  
## Process

 - Docker
 - Metamask connection
 - Figma
 - Smartcontract
 - npm install react-ipfs-uploader
 - npm install ipfs -g (for ipfs)

## Business model

pas besoin de bcp de personnes (peu couteux)
ajout differents type de contracts -> toucher une plus grande audience 

## üß≠ Roadmap

- [x] Docker installation
- [x] Metamask wallet connection
- [ ] Smart contract
    - [x] Write our own contract
    - [ ] Use of Starton API to create Smart contract from bytecode
    - [ ] Use of Starton API to calls Smart contract located at {address} on {network}
    - [ ] Deletes Smart contract located at {address} on {network}
- [x] Add image uploader on IPFS
- [ ] Form:
    - [ ] Interaction with Smart contract at {address} on {network}

## Development perspective
Create a DAO,
